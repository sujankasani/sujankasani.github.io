									<strong><h3>Abstract</h3></strong>
									<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.CcizasAn_JruX6fkdqNmPQHaD4?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" align="right">
									<p>A new fabrication route, which combines nanosphere lithography>with silicon-based
										 clean-room microfabrication processes, has been developed to produce large-area 
										 long-range ordered gold nanoring array patterns in a controllable fashion. Both the 
										 experimentation and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation show that the 
										 surface plasmon resonance peak (SPR) of the nanoring array pattern can be tuned 
										 systematically in a large spectral range by varying the geometry parameters such as
										  the ring thickness, the ring height, the ringer outer diameter, and the gap between 
										  neighboring rings. For the Au nanoring arrays with a large gap in the absence of 
										  plasmon coupling between neighboring rings, the local electromagnetic (EM) field

									<strong><h3>Abstract</h3></strong>
									<p>This review article discusses progress in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) chip-based nanostructure array patterns. Recent advancements in fabrication techniques for nano-arrays have endowed researchers with tools to explore a material's plasmonic optical properties. In this review, fabrication techniques including electron-beam lithography, focused-ion lithography, dip-pen lithography, laser interference lithography, nanosphere lithography, nanoimprint lithography, and anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template-based lithography are introduced and discussed. Nano- arrays have gained increased attention because of their optical property dependency (light-matter interactions) on size, shape, and periodicity. In particular, nano-array architectures can be tailored to produce and tune plasmonic modes such as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), surface plasmon polariton (SPP), extraordinary transmission, surface lattice resonance (SLR), Fano resonance, plasmonic whispering-gallery modes (WGMs), and plasmonic gap mode. Thus, light management (absorption, scattering, transmission, and guided wave propagation), as well as electromagnetic (EM) field enhancement, can be controlled by rational design and fabrication of plasmonic nano-arrays. Because of their optical properties, these plasmonic modes can be utilized for designing plasmonic sensors and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensors.</p>

									<p>This paper presents a p-n heterojunction photoanode based on a p-type porphyrin metal-organic framework (MOF) thin film and an n-type rutile titanium dioxide nanorod array for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The TiO₂@MOF core-shell nanorod array is formed by coating an 8 nm thick MOF layer on a vertically aligned TiO2 nanorod array scaffold via a layer- by-layer self-assembly method. This vertically aligned core-shell nanorod array enables a long optical path length but a short path length for extraction of photogenerated minority charge carriers (holes) from TiO₂ to the electrolyte. A p-n junction is formed between TiO, and MOF, which improves the extraction of photogenerated electrons and holes out of the TiO₂ nanorods. In addition, the MOF coating significantly improves the efficiency of charge injection at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. Introduction of Co(III) into the MOF layer further enhances the charge extraction in the photoanode and improves the charge injection efficiency. As a result, the photoelectrochemical cell with the TiO₂@Co-MOF nanorod array photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 2.93 mA/cm² at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), which is ~ 2.7 times the photocurrent achieved with bare TiO2 nanorod array under irradiation of an unfiltered 300 W Xe lamp with an output power density of 100 mW/cm².</p>

									<p>Nutrient pollution is of worldwide environmental and health concerns due to extensive use of nitrogen fertilizers and release of livestock waste, which induces nitrite compounds in aquatic systems. Herein a surface- enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor is developed for nitrite detection based on coupling between the plasmonic gold nanostars and the silver nanopyramid array. When nitrite is present in the assay, an azo group is formed between the 1-naphthylamine-functionalized silver nanopyramids and the 4-aminothiophenol-functionalized gold nanostars. This not only generates the SERS spectral fingerprint for selective detection, but also creates "hot spots" at the gap between the Au nanostars and the Ag nanopyramids where the azo group is located, amplifying SERS signals remarkably. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation shows a SERS enhancement factor of 4x1010 at the "hot spots". As a result, the SERS sensor achieves a limit of detection of 0.6 pg/mL toward nitrite in water, and enables nitrite detection in real-world river water samples. In addition, this sensor eliminates the use of any Raman reporter and any expensive molecular recognition probe such as antibody and aptamer. This highly sensitive, selective and inexpensive SERS sensor has unique advantages over colorimetric, electrochemical and fluorescent devices for small molecule detection.</p>

									<p>Conventional paper lateral flow assays have low sensitivity and suffer from severe interference from complex human fluid sample matrices, which prevents their practical application in the testing of whole blood samples in the point-of-care settings. To solve this problem, gold nanostar@Raman reporter@silica-sandwiched nanoparticles have been developed as the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) probes for sensing transduction; and a functionalized filter membrane assembly has been designed and constructed in the paper-based lateral flow strip (PLFS) as a built-in plasma separation unit.

									<strong><h3>Abstract</h3></strong>
									<p>Currently colorimetric paper lateral flow strips (PLFS) encounter two major limitations, that is, low sensitivity and severe interference from complex sample matrices such as blood. These shortcomings limit their application in detection of low-concentration analytes in complex samples. To solve these problems, a PLFS has been developed by utilizing surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for sensing signal transduction. In particular, a hierarchical three-dimensional nanostructure has been designed to create “hot spots”, which can significantly amplify the SERS sensing signal, leading to high sensitivity. As a result, this PLFS has demonstrated a limit of detection (LOD) of 5.0 pg mL−1 toward detection of S-100β, a traumatic brain injury (TBI) protein biomarker in blood plasma. The PLFS has been successfully used for rapid measurement of S-100β in clinical TBI patient samples taken in the emergency department. Availability of PLFS for blood testing would shift the paradigm of TBI patient management and clinical outcome in emergency departments. It is expected that this type of PLFS can be adapted for rapid detection of various human diseases due to its capability of measuring a low level of protein blood biomarkers in complex human fluids.

									<p>Pristine and Bi-doped lanthanum titanium oxide (La2Ti2O7) nanosheets have been synthesized as photocatalysts for overall solar water splitting. The surface hole trap is a critical factor that limits the photocatalytic activity of pristine La2Ti2O7. Deposition of cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles on La2Ti2O7 cannot remove the surface traps although they are essential for enabling the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. It is interesting that doping bismuth (Bi) into La2Ti2O7 nanosheets has eliminated the surface traps due to surface enrichment of Bi. The Co-Pi/Bi-La2Ti2O7/Pt nanosheets exhibit increasing photocatalytic activity toward overall water splitting with increasing the Bi-dopant level up to 5 at.%. Further increasing the Bi-dopant level leads to the formation of localized states above the valence band, leading to the lifetime reduction of photogenerated charge-carriers, and jeopardizing the photocatalytic activity. This work proposes an effective strategy to address the surface trapping and surface catalysis issues in the nanostructured metal oxide photocatalysts.</p>

									<p>Due to the increasing use of automobiles, the transportation industry is facing challenges of increased emissions, driver safety concerns, travel demand, etc. Hence, automotive industries are manufacturing vehicles that produce fewer emissions, are fuel-efficient, and provide safety for drivers. Artificial intelligence has taken a major leap recently and provides unprecedented opportunities to enhance performance, including in the automotive and transportation sectors. Artificial intelligence shows promising results in the trucking industry for increasing productivity, sustainability, reliability, and safety. Compared to passenger vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles present challenges due to their larger dimensions/weight and require attention to dynamics during operation. Data collected from vehicles can be used for emission and fuel consumption testing, as the drive cycle data represent real-world operating characteristics based on heavy-duty vehicles and their vocational use. Understanding the activity profiles of heavy-duty vehicles is important for freight companies to meet fuel consumption and emission standards, prevent unwanted downtime, and ensure the safety of drivers. Utilizing the large amount of data being collected these days and advanced computational methods such as artificial intelligence can help obtain insights in less time without on-road testing. However, the availability of data and the ability to apply data analysis/machine learning methods on heavy-duty vehicles have room for improvement in areas such as autonomous trucks, connected vehicles, predictive maintenance, fault diagnosis, etc. This paper presents a review of work on artificial intelligence, recent advancements, and research challenges in the trucking industry. Different applications of artificial intelligence in heavy-duty trucks, such as fuel consumption prediction, emissions estimation, self-driving technology, and predictive maintenance using various machine learning and deep learning methods, are discussed.</p>

									<strong><h3>Abstract</h3></strong>

									<p>Since the invention of the first visible spectrum (red) LED by Holonyak in 1962, there has been a 
										need for more efficient, more reliable and less expensive LEDs. The III-nitrides revolutionized 
										semiconductor technology with their applications in the blue LED’s.  However the internal 
										quantum efficiency of LED’s are limited by the deep level traps in GaN substrate. Traps are 
										defects in the crystal lattice, which depends on growth parameters. These traps act as non
										radiative centers where non-radiative recombination occurs without conversion of available 
										energy into light. Characterization of these traps in a material is necessary for better 
										understanding of the material growth quality and resulting device performance. In this work 
										Capacitance-Voltage (C-V) and Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) are conducted 
										which provide electronic properties of trap centers like activation energy, doping concentration 
										and capture cross-section.  In n-GaN grown by Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition 
										(MOCVD) on Sapphire two defects types are detected and are characterized by Capacitance
										Voltage and Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy. Two deep levels E1 and E2 are typically 
										observed in n-GaN with the activation energies of 0.21eV and 0.53eV at 125°K and 325°K, 
										respectively. The deep level E1 is caused by linear line defects along dislocation cores while

Various lengths of TiO2 nanorods with lengths 1.35, 1.85, 2.5 and 4.5 micrometers were prepared and used in the present investigation. Front and back illumination in SPV and PEC Mott-Schottky plots were investigated and found to show significant difference in charge carrier separation. The hole diffusion length calculations using PEC was up to 200 nm and using SPV was in the order of 600-700nm.
